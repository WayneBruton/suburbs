    </div>
    <div class="about-content text-center">
      <p>The Suburbs Directory was born in early 2019 with the idea being conceived in early 2018.</p>

      <p>The Suburbs Directory was formed to be the business platform for 7 successful community Facebook Groups. The
        seven groups are South Peninsula Sell & Swop, Southern Suburbs Sell & Swop, City Bowl Sell & Swop, Northern
        Suburbs Sell & Swop, Atlantic Seaboard Sell & Swop, West Coast Sell & Swop and Helderberg Sell & Swop.</p>

      <p>It all started with South Peninsula Sell & Swop in 2015, a community based Facebook group, where its members
        were able to buy, sell & swop second hand goods, share information and connect with the greater community. Over
        the last three years the group has grown from strength to strength and currently hosts more than 14 000
        members. </p>

      <p>In early 2019 we decided to allow businesses access to the groups by offering them an advertising opportunity
        via our online directory. This allows businesses to access the enormous amount of foot traffic on each of the
        Facebook groups. </p>
      <p><strong>structure:</strong></p>
      Choose your package (There are a couple of different packages available. Your package will include a website
      listing and allow you to post on one or more of the seven facebook groups either once or twice a week (depending
      on your package option) Each option is priced individually. If you would like to request a package breakdown,
      please email <a href="mailto: lisa@suburbsdirectory.co.za">lisa@suburbsdirectory.co.za</a>.
      If you do not have a business listing / package with The Suburbs Directory, you will not be allowed to advertise
      your business on any of the seven Facebook pages.</p>

      <p> The decision to run The Business Directory alongside our Facebook groups was not based on the idea of
        building a business empire, but rather on the idea of how we can impact on job creation and the communities
        around us.</p>

      <p> How do we plan on doing this you may ask? We have put a few structures in place to make sure we stick to our
        promise of job creation, impacting positively and effectively on each of our seven communities and giving back
        to the businesses that list with us and help us to achieve our first two promises.
        Job creation: As each of the seven areas on The Suburbs Directory grows our goal is to employ two people to
        manage each area. We would eventually like to see one person managing the facebook group and one person running
        The Suburbs Directory side of things for the specific group area.</p>

      <p>Impact on our communities: Each of the seven suburbs will have one NPO / NGO assigned to it per year. This NPO
        / NGO would form part of the specific community that it has been assigned to. That NPO / NGO will then receive
        a monthly donation from us for the next 12 months, all based on how many businesses are registered with that
        specific suburb, so the more business listings that Suburb has, the more money that community project will
        receive from The Suburbs Directory.</p>

      <p>Giving back to the businesses that list with us: We believe that supporting each other in business is an
        essential part of growing a healthy, supportive and fundamentally sound business community. In order for us to
        play our part in this, we have decided to include a business give back, where we give a financial percentage
        back to one listed business each quarter. We would like to eventually be giving back around <strong>R5000</strong> per quarter
        in each of the seven suburbs, that’s <strong>R20 000</strong> per year per suburb!
        As we watch the growth of each of the Facebook Groups we realize the need to offer this service to businesses.
        We also understand that digital marketing plays a vital role for businesses both large and small.</p>
      <p>We are excited to see a strong reputable business community form within each of the seven areas of the Western
        Cape, whilst contributing effectively to job creation, the communities around us and to each of the businesses
        who support us.</p>
